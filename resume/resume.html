                    <p class="info">As graphic design student with a passion for Layout, UX/UI design, and Illustration it is always important to think of goals and plan ahead.
                    <br>  
                    <br>I look at graphic design as communication, meaning that the work has to have a vibe to connect to the viewer or perceiver. I make a black and white drawing and then add color digitally, bringing in a contemporary pattern to the composition to create a vibrance.
